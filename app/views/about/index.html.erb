      <p>Are you ready to become the next Giggler?</p>

      <p>An online platform that connects gigs employers and employees.
        Gigs employers and employees have to setup their profiles to build their
        reputation and trustfulness. Empolyees can post review and rate their employers
        and vice versa.</p>

        <h5>How it works?</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Gig employers post a job including: duty, requirement, rate and etc...</li>
          <li>Employees: search for a gig and apply if they want to take the job.</li>
          (pretty much like the gigs section on Craigslist)
        </ol>

        <h5>Why this matter?</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Employers can build good profolio so they can hire people easier.</li>
        <li>Workers have less protection working on Gigs.</li>
        <li>Workers can report scam and help each other to avoid being scammed.</li>
        </ul>
