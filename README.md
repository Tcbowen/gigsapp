Gigs: A web app
https://gigsapp-115.herokuapp.com/

This is from a push

An online platform that connects gigs employers and workers.
Gigs employers and workers have to setup their profiles to build their reputation and trustfulness.
Workers can post review and rate their employers and vice versa.

How it works?
Gig employers post a job including: duty, requirement, rate and etc...
Workers: search for a gig and apply if they want to take the job.
(pretty much like the gigs section on Craigslist)

Why this matter?
+ Employers can build good profolio so they can hire people easier.
+ Workers have less protection working on Gigs.
+ Workers can report scam and help each other to avoid being scammed.
